<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>I’m Laura Kalbag, a designer and British person, now living in Cork, Ireland. I wrote a book about web accessibility called <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone">Accessibility For Everyone</a>. You can <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone">buy it in paperback or ebook from A Book Apart</a>.</p>

<p>I’m one third of <a href="https://ind.ie">Ind.ie</a>, a tiny two-person-and-one-husky not-for-profit working for social justice in the digital age. At Ind.ie, we work on building a more ethical web, make <a href="https://better.fyi">a web privacy tool called Better</a>, and follow the <a href="https://ind.ie/ethical-design">Ethical Design Manifesto</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-pronounce-kalbag">How do I pronounce Kalbag?</h3>

<p>My surname is Kalbag. It is pronounced <strong>cal</strong> as in <strong>cal</strong>ories, and <strong>bag</strong> as in… <strong>bag</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-a-designer">I am a designer</h2>

<p>As part of a tiny team, I do a lot under the title of designer. <a href="https://ar.al">Aral</a> and I work together on the holistic design of Ind.ie. I work on everything from graphic design to web development while learning how to run a sustainable social enterprise.</p>

<p>My work means I’m always striving to make privacy and broader ethics in technology accessible to a wide audience. You can typically find me making design decisions, writing CSS, nudging icon pixels, or distilling a privacy policy into something humans can understand. Sometimes, I <a href="../speaking/index.html" title="Speaking">speak at conferences</a> and <a href="../tag/writing/index.html">write</a> articles, too.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<p>Honest, sustainable, and independent design is important to me. I believe the web should be owned and controlled by the people who use it, and we who create technology should do so ethically and responsibly.</p>

<p>I also speak and write regularly about the importance of <a href="../tag/accessibility/index.html">accessibility</a> and <a href="https://ind.ie/summit/videos/laura-kalbag">diversity</a> in the tech and design industries. I first became interested in the web because I loved how it made information and shared experiences available to (almost) everybody. I want to work for a web that is equally accessible to all people. And to do that, our industry must be as diverse as the people who use what we create.</p>
