				<p>Angry thoughts while updating the Better Blocker blocklist… (I get them every time!)</p>

<p>If you are providing third party services on a domain that is entirely unrelated to your (or any previously acquired) business name, you look veeeery sketchy…</p>

<p>I’m looking at you, Adobe. 👀</p>

<p>If you do this <em>and</em> you hide your domain ownership in whois, you are extra sketchy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nothing makes me angry quite like researching trackers for Better Blocker.</p>

<hr />

<p>Use <a href="https://better.fyi">Better Blocker</a>? There’s new block rules waiting for you. Open the app to fetch them. A couple of little fixes and a couple of new trackers blocked. I’ll get more sorted over the next week (these were a little tricksy!)</p>

	<div class="summary">
		<p>Writing a few blog posts last week, and cross-posting them in various locations, got me thinking about how meta information can be reused.
I started looking into the meta information in the &lt;head&gt; of each page, and how best to format it so that social networks (Twitter, Facebook, messaging apps…) would pick up on titles, descriptions and images. That way, when I share a URL from my site, if the site/app has the functionality, they can expand that URL into a preview including a nicely-formatted title, summary, and image. <a href="/crossposting-using-meta/">Read Cross-posting using meta information</a>.

		<p>The state of sharing on the web is broken.
After the Snowden revelations, it became clear that my sharing “content” willy-nilly was a potential danger to me. I was previously oblivious to the risk of sharing everything about myself on social media. The tiniest most harmless piece of information about me could be derived in a data set somewhere to become something very meaningful (even if it’s wrong) and potentially dangerous. <a href="/insecure/">Read Insecure</a>.

		<p>When I wrote about owning and controlling my own content, I talked about trying to keep my “content” in its canonical location on my site, and then syndicating it to social networks and other sites. Doing this involves cross-posting, something that can be done manually (literally copying and pasting titles, descriptions, links etc) or through automation. Either way, it’s a real faff. Posting to my site alone is a faff. <a href="/beyond-my-means/">Read Beyond my means</a>.
