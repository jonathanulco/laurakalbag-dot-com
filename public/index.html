				<p>Given that there’s a couple of women in UK parliament throwing the word “prostitute” around, I found this and it seems to be informative:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-sex-work-open-society">Understanding Sex Work in an Open Society</a></p>

<p>tldr; sex work and human trafficking are different, lumping everything under “prostitution” is unhelpful/harmful.</p>

		This was my opening introduction for Futurefest’s “Who Is the Internet For?” debate today in London. I didn’t hit all the points as smoothly as this, but I covered most of it throughout the debate.
 In the description for this session, it says “Without the inputs from internet users with physical impairments we wouldn’t have the voice technology underpinning Siri or Alexa.” But what is the cost of using Alexa for people who would find it difficult or impossible to access the web or technology without voice recognition? <a href="/the-cost-of-access/">Read The cost of access</a>.

		CSS Grid Layout is great. My site layout is fairly simple, so had no need for lots of grid—I only used it for lining up comments and avatars on old blog posts.
Working on my Notes section, I realised I’d sometimes be adding multiple images (dog photos) in one note. The default style for my images is big and full-width, but two or three full-width images in rows would likely be overwhelming. <a href="/gallery-grid-with-css-grid/">Read Gallery Grid With CSS Grid</a>.

		On Saturday, we celebrated the victory for Irish people as they repealed the anti-abortion laws. We were celebrating not just because we care about the rights of people with uteruses, but also because we have now been resident in Ireland for two months. And we love it here.
Why move? If you know Aral and me, you’ll know we’ve been trying to find the right home for the last three or four years. <a href="/move-to-ireland/">Read Hello Ireland</a>.
