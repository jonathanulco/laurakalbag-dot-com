Well, things didn’t slow down in 2014! So much so that I didn’t manage to write this post yesterday. In 2014 I spoke at 8 events in 4 countries, and worked with 11 clients on 15 projects before starting work full time with [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie) in August.

I wrote a lot more, with regular slots on[ A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/author/laurakalbag) and [The Pastry Box](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/laura-kalbag), and a series on [Getting Started With Sass on Web Standards Sherpa](http://webstandardssherpa.com/about/authors/laura-kalbag/). And I had more fun on podcasts including co-hosting [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz) with Ashley Baxter in August.

Again, I’ve summarised my year in photos:

## Following goals for 2014

### 1. Collaborate more.

Joining Ind.ie meant I went from working remotely, to suddenly working with a team of people in our house every day. It definitely resulted in a lot more collaboration!

### 2. Be more selective, say no more often.

Early on in the year, I decided to only speak at an event every other month. I mostly succeeded in this, and it meant I was less stressed, and also enjoyed the events I spoke at a lot more.

### 3. Challenge myself physically in a new way.

I sort-of managed this one. I tried ballet, but it’s not for me anymore. I tried Crossfit, but the nearest location is slightly too far away to attend frequently. Doing much more challenging courses of Pilates has had a positive impact on my year.

## Goals for 2015

I have a big writing project to finish, which needs hard work and lot of confidence, but I also want to share more design and development writing on my blog and the [Ind.ie blog](https://ind.ie/about/blog).

1. Write more.
2. Read more.
3. Make the most of Ind.ie.

My life has changed a lot in the last year as I’ve started working with Ind.ie. It’s really important to me that we make a difference, and create alternatives to spyware technologies. I’ve got an amazing opportunity to work with the rest of the team to do something about the current system. I need to make sure I make the most of it, work hard, don’t let my insecurities get the better of me, and stand up for what I believe in.

		I wish you the achievement of the goals for the year 2015. I’ve got one question about your work.  When your effectiveness is better, when you work as a freelance? or as you work in a team?

Sorry if I made some mistakes in the sentences above. :&gt;

		@Damian thanks :)

I find there’s benefits in both working freelance and in a team. There’s less disruption during the working day if you’re working alone. But when you work in a team you can make more progress coming up with ideas, learning from each other, and bouncing thoughts and problems around.
