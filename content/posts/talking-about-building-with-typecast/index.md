Last November at Build conference 2012, I had fun talking to some of the folks from Typecast about building, web design, responsive design and type. They recorded these videos (along with a load of lovely, smart and cool people!) and [made a nice collection that you can watch on their website](http://typecast.com/build).

[Typecast are also giving away a ticket to Build conference 2013 and some Typecast subscriptions](http://typecast.com/build#win). The draw closes tomorrow, so youâ€™d better be quick!
