[This Thursday I’m speaking at Milton Keynes Geek Night](http://mkgeeknight.co.uk). Tickets sold out terrifyingly quickly, but I put that down to MKGN always being a great event.

I’m going to talk about self-discipline, it’s a new talk and so that makes me even more nervous than usual!{{< figured >}}
