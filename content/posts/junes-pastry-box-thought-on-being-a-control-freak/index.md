Following on from [my post yesterday about working with Indie Phone for 50% of my time](/indie-phone/ "Becoming part of Indie Phone"), [my thought on the Pastry Box today is about how I accidentally became a control freak](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/laura-kalbag/2014-June-5). It’s hard to admit the flaws you find in yourself, but I’m so determined to do a good job that I think it’s better to find those flaws and try to fix them!
