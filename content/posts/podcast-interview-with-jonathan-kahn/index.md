Ahead of [speaking at Dare conference](/speaking-at-dare-conference/ "Speaking at Dare conference") this September, [I was interviewed by Jonathan Kahn](http://lucidplot.com/2013/08/05/kalbag-podcast/), one of Dare’s organisers, about being honest, client relationships and mentoring in the web industry.

It was lovely chatting to Jonathan, and his [podcast also has a proper transcript](http://lucidplot.com/2013/08/05/kalbag-podcast/) if you’re more of a reading person than a listening person :)
