## Prejudice

### A new study finds a potential risk with self-driving cars: failure to detect dark-skinned pedestrians

By Sigal Samuel on Vox

> “The list of concerns about self-driving cars just got longer. 
>
> In addition to worrying about how safe they are, how they’d handle tricky moral trade-offs on the road, and how they might make traffic worse, we also need to worry about how they could harm people of color.”

### Reclaiming privacy: a feminist manifesto

On Privacy International

> “So, what does privacy have to do with this? This question calls for another question: whose privacy are we fighting for when we say we defend the right to privacy? Talking about privacy in the abstract – as if we all benefit from the same rights, as if we are all equal – means taking the risk of defending the rights of only the most privileged ones in society – with privilege coming in different forms from having a voice to be heard to socio-economic status.”

### “London-based angry feminists over 30”: why we need to talk about the sexism of online ad profiling

By Eva Blum-Dumontet on New Statesman

> “We need to be clear that a data driven world – where artificial intelligence makes decision based on simplistic profiles about us – isn’t going to solve prejudices: it’s going to perpetuate them.”

### These gaffes expose British politics’ real issue with race

By Gary Younge on The Guardian

> “Racism is not about politeness – it’s about power. What is truly worrying about these blunders is that they have let the mask slip to reveal a political class that, at best, does not understand the racial dynamics of the country in which it operates and, at worst, is deeply hostile to them.”

### The gender wars of household chores: a feminist comic

By Emma on The Guardian

> “The French comic artist Emma illustrates the concept of the ‘mental load’. When a man expects his partner to ask him to do things, he is viewing her as the manager of their household chores”

## Tech’s systemic issues


### Mark Zuckerberg discovers privacy

By Taylor Hatmaker on Techcrunch

> “But can Facebook reform its 15-year legacy as devourer of all things private with a single sweeping, underedited screed from its copycat visionary and dark-pattern technocrat? Fuck no, of course it can’t.”

### Why beating your phone addiction may come at a cost

By Oscar Schwartz on The Guardian

> “as this burgeoning movement becomes an industry, some worry that the “wellness” approach and its emphasis on personal responsibility is whitewashing deeper structural issues within the tech industry.”
