While working on a recent refactor, I thought it might be fun to look at my site design over the years. There are definitely some threads I’ve stuck to over the years…<!--more-->

## 2008

2008 is the earliest version of my site I can find on the Web Archive. But it is HTML-only, so I can’t tell what the styling was, but I suspect it was been an early version of what was there in 2010. At least if I tell myself the design is a decade old, I feel a bit better…

## 2010

Let’s start with the most mortifying…

{{<figure class="grid" src="/images/2018/08/v-2010-home.png" alt="Screenshot of an obnoxious early redesign that has a grid aesthetic with a very brightly coloured background pattern." caption="Thumbs up? Despite the design looking table-like, the whole design is done with floats and painstaking pixels. Pain is probably what you feel when you look at the combined colours and textures of the background. Textures were very trendy." src2="/images/2018/08/v-2010-about.png" alt2="Screenshot of the About page from 2010, which is similar to the Home page but features a boring list of my so-called skills at the time." src3="/images/2018/08/v-2010-contact.png" alt3="Screenshot of the Contact page from 2010, which sports a similar design to the other two pages, but also a very formal-looking contact form.">}}

## 2012

You can’t tell from the screenshot, but this was my first responsive incarnation of my personal site.

{{<figure class="grid" src="/images/2018/08/v-2012-home.png" alt="Screenshot of the 2012 homepage which has a brightly-coloured purple ackground with a swatch palette of colours below the navigation, and a background illustration in white pen." caption="2012 was when I first toyed with using different colour themes on different pages. I’ve always loved colour and still think this is a fun way to use it. The swatch panel features more colours than were used in the CSS itself. The background was hand-drawn and scanned in. It was an unnecessarily large file." src2="/images/2018/08/v-2012-about.png" alt2="Screenshot of the About page from 2012, which is similar to the Home page but has a green colour theme, and a different pen drawing featuring a little solar system." src3="/images/2018/08/v-2012-contact.png" alt3="Screenshot of the Contact page from 2012, which is similar to the other two pages but with a teal colour theme and another different white pen illustration.">}}

The pen illustrations were only featured on the main site pages, I didn’t want to overcrowd the portfolio pages. Somehow overcrowding the main pages was fine.

## April 2015

Going corporate? I know this was slightly more sophisticated design, but looking at it against the previous versions, it looks a bit boring.

{{<figure class="grid" src="/images/2018/08/v-2015-home.png" alt="Screenshot of the 2018 homepage ." caption="CAPTION" src2="/images/2018/08/v-2015-about.png" alt2="Screenshot of the About page from 2018, which is similar to the Home page." src3="/images/2018/08/v-2015-contact.png" alt3="Screenshot of the Contact page from 2018, which .">}}

## November 2017

{{<figure class="grid" src="/images/2018/08/v-2018-home.png" alt="Screenshot of the 2018 homepage ." caption="CAPTION" src2="/images/2018/08/v-2018-about.png" alt2="Screenshot of the About page from 2018, which is similar to the Home page." src3="/images/2018/08/v-2018-contact.png" alt3="Screenshot of the Contact page from 2018, which .">}}
