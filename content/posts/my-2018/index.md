My first yearly roundup since [my 2015 roundup](/my-2015). I’ve blogged over the last three years, so I needn’t summarise the last three years. Just 2018. My initial thoughts on 2018 were “I’ve not done enough.” But, actually, thinking back on it, I shouldn’t be so hard on myself.<!--more-->

[Skip to photos](#photos)

One of the reasons I felt behind on work was because of how much travelling I’ve done. We started the year in Ghent, working on the [Indienet initiative](https://indienet.info). Working with the folks in Ghent, and travelling for conferences really dominated the first few of months of 2018.

In March, [we moved from Malmö in Sweden to Cork in Ireland](/move-to-ireland). And over 2018, we settled in far quicker than we did in Malmö. Being closer to the UK meant I returned more often to see my family, and it was easier for us to return to North East England for my grandfather’s funeral in November. Travelling is still utterly exhausting, I’ll never be good at it. But I’ve been learning better not to plan too much and burn out too hard with each trip.

The second half of 2018 was dominated by [Better](https://better.fyi). Ahead of our releasing [redesigned apps for iOS and macOS in September](https://ar.al/2018/09/14/better-simpler-and-more-affordable/), I stepped up my work on [Better’s blocking rules](https://better.fyi/news) to try to publish new rules every couple of weeks (which ended up being fairly all-encompassing). This resulted in [a lot of ranting and griping on social media](https://laurakalbag.com/notes/17/) whenever I had to block another awful tracker, or work my way around a site’s unethical attempts to block blockers. But it did give me more insight into how trackers work, how the businesses behind them operate, and how an extraordinary number of developers deploy prototyping code to live sites.

I don’t set New Year goals anymore. Just going to try to keep on keeping on. Trying to be better and trying to do better. (Pun not intended!)

Photos time!
