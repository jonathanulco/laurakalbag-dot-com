[My second column for A List Apart, “Open for Business,” is now up](http://alistapart.com/column/open-for-business). I wrote Open for Business as a follow-up to my [Dare conference](http://2013.dareconf.com) talk about honesty. It’s not the same as the full talk (and has been edited into a far better shape by Rose Weisburd) but is the essence of why I feel that being open works for my business.
