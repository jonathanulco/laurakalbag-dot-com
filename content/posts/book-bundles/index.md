*3rd July: NEW BOOKS ADDED!*

[We’re moving](https://aralbalkan.com/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/). And because we’re moving abroad, we’re [getting rid of all of our stuff](http://www.gumtree.com/sellerads/1119077228).

[Just take me to the books already](#books)

[Aral](https://aralbalkan.com/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/) and I have a lot of books between us. We’re sad to lose them. Many have been gifts from friends, written by people we know, and helped us do what we do.

Selling books one by one is a time-consuming (and not cost-effective) exercise. Inspired by my friend Al Power coming over and asking “which books do you have on Typography?” I thought they’d be worth selling as bundles. All these books are worth way more than we’re selling them for, but we’re in a rush and want them to go to good homes. I’ve not done any particularly complicated pricing. Small books are £8 per bundle. Four small books: £10. Two small books: £5. Big books are £12 per bundle. Big book bundles with two books are £10. They’re all in good condition, most nearly-new. A few come with bonus margin notes…

There’s more (lots of bigger books) coming! If people show interest in this, we’ve got more on typography, art, programming languages and more.

## Postage options

The problem with books is that they cost a fortune to post. So I’ve bundled them all under 2kg so we can keep the post cheap. (Oddly, 2kg costs more to post than 2 x 1kg.) They fall into two categories: below 1kg, and above 1kg. (Listed alongside the bundles)

If you want them 2nd class to save the pennies, that’s cool too.

### Below 1kg postage

### Above 1kg
