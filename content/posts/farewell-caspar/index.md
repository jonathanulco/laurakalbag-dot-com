We didn’t have an Ind.ie roundup the previous week because we were moving, though [Aral wrote a quick update on what’s happening with our move](https://ind.ie/blog/july-update/). Last week we were roundup-less again, as we heard the sad news that [Caspar Bowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Bowden) had died. We decided that, instead of the usual roundup, we’d take a look at [Caspar’s privacy advocacy in tribute to his work](https://ind.ie/blog/farewell-caspar/).
