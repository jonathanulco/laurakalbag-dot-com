A couple of months ago, Ian from logogeek.co.uk, asked if I’d share some of my sketchbook pages on his site. Ian wanted to emphasise the rough, imperfect nature of the way we plan logo designs, and show real work done by real people.

Last week, Ian added some pages from my sketchbook to [his post, “A look inside a designers sketchbook”](http://learnlogodesign.com/logo-design-process/a-look-inside-a-designers-sketchbook). He included some of my sketches from the [Indie Phone](/project/indiephone-logo/ "IndiePhone logo") and [Turbine](/project/turbine-logo/ "Turbine logo") projects. As he didn’t include all of them, I thought I’d share them all below.

		<p>Thanks for sharing all this pages.

It’s quite good to see that your sketches are –; in my opinion –; far away from a perfect “drawing” and that a logo isn’t born as you can see it in its final state but it “grew up” with some iterations on it.

While being not really good at all this painting stuff it encourages me keep on noting down my ideas with pictures and some rough lines.

Again, thanks for sharing this, Laura! :)</p>	</div>
