Probably the coolest I’ve ever sounded…

Last week Ind.ie was featured in a Guardian article, [‘The punk rock internet – how DIY ​​rebels ​are working to ​replace the tech giants.’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/punk-rock-internet-diy-rebels-working-replace-tech-giants-snoopers-charter) We were interviewed by John Harris, and I think he did a really great job of explaining what we do and why we do it.

Not having massive experience in being interviewed, I was a little nervous that I’d sound a bit daft, especially as I’m nowhere near as eloquent as Aral. But overall, I think the quotes were good and it works as a primer that I’ll be sharing whenever somebody asks what we do at Ind.ie!

There’s a nice little paragraph where I sum up the why of it all…

> “I got into the web because I liked the democracy of it,” says Kalbag, who has just published a book titled Accessibility for Everyone, about innovating in a way that includes those who technology too often ignores – not least people with disabilities. “I want to be able to be in a society where I have control over my information, and other people do as well. Being a woman in technology, you can see how hideously unequal things are and how people building these systems don’t care about anyone other than themselves. I think we have to have technology that serves everybody – not just rich, straight, white guys.”
