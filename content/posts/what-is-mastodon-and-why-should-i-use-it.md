This post is a follow-up to [What’s wrong with Twitter?](/what-is-wrong-with-twitter)

<hr/>

Mastodon started out with many similar features to Twitter, such as character limit on posts, but has evolved with more features that show a progressive and inclusive focus.<!--more-->

There’s a truly good [Toot How-to: Intro to Mastodon by Ginny McQueen](medium.com/@GinnyMcQueen/toot-how-to-intro-to-mastodon-e5655bfa87d2) that covers all the introductory basics. Also [How Does Mastodon Work? By Kev Quirk](kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/) introduces Mastodon with comparisons to Twitter, in case that makes it easier to understand.

If you’re looking for apps and web clients for using with Mastodon, beyond the default interface, check out [the definitive list](github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/Apps.md) of apps. It also has other useful stuff listed, such as cross-posting tools.


## Why use Mastodon and not another new social network?

Mastodon is unique for a few reasons:

### Mastodon is (mostly) decentralised

- what is decentralisation and why is it important?

### Mastodon is federated

- what is federation and why is it useful?
- [mastodon.social/@CM_noelle/100546476154517859](https://mastodon.social/@CM_noelle/100546476154517859)

### Mastodon is created and maintained by people who are ethical and inclusive

- examples of design decisions that are more inclusive (research these)

### But even if they weren’t ethical and inclusive anymore, we wouldn’t be stuck





# Some answers to some common statements…

I’d call them questions, but they’re not…


### But all my friends/cool people/interesting discussions are on Twitter…

Were all your friends, the cool people, and the interesting discussions on Twitter when you joined? 


### I don’t have the time to join another social network

- is it free and open
- Why do people keep inviting me to their instances
- Can instances talk to each other
- Does it matter which instance you join
