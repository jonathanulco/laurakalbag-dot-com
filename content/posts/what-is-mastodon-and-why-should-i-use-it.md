This post is a follow-up to [What’s wrong with Twitter?](/what-is-wrong-with-twitter)

<hr/>

Mastodon started out with many similar features to Twitter, such as character limit on posts, but has evolved with more features that show a progressive and inclusive focus.<!--more-->

If you’re looking for apps and web clients for using with Mastodon, beyond the default interface, check out [the definitive list](github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/Apps.md) of apps. It also has other useful stuff listed, such as cross-posting tools.


## Why use Mastodon and not another new social network?

Mastodon is unique for a few reasons:

### Mastodon is (mostly) decentralised

- what is decentralisation and why is it important?

### Mastodon is federated

- what is federation and why is it useful?
- [mastodon.social/@CM_noelle/100546476154517859](https://mastodon.social/@CM_noelle/100546476154517859)

### Mastodon is created and maintained by people who are ethical and inclusive

- examples of design decisions that are more inclusive (research these)

### But even if they weren’t ethical and inclusive anymore, we wouldn’t be stuck



## How to use Mastodon

I’m not an expert, and my use of Mastodon is still in its infancy. Here are a list of great How-To guides by people who know Mastodon far better than me:

- **[An Increasingly Less-Brief Guide to Mastodon by @joyeusenoelle](https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/)**—Simply-written guide following a Frequently-Asked-Questions format. Useful if you want to find an answer to a specific question.
- **[Toot How-to: Intro to Mastodon by Ginny McQueen](medium.com/@GinnyMcQueen/toot-how-to-intro-to-mastodon-e5655bfa87d2)**—Covers all the introductory basics to Mastodon with an eye on keeping yourself safe. 
- **[What is Mastodon and why is it better than Twitter by Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/10/23/what-is-mastodon-and-why-is-it-better-than-twitter/)**—A detailed introduction to Mastodon and some of its history.
- **[Cage The Mastodon by Eugen Rochko](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)**—“An overview of features for dealing with abuse and harassment” which also explains the design decisions behind Mastodon.
- **[How Does Mastodon Work? By Kev Quirk](kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/)**—Introduces Mastodon with comparisons to Twitter, in case that makes it easier to understand.

## Important: Join a small instance/your own instance

- Why don't you (Ind.ie) make an instance we can join?

1. Because I do not have the training/strength

2. Because we are working away from centralisation.

## But all my friends/cool people/interesting discussions are on Twitter…

Were all your friends, the cool people, and the interesting discussions on Twitter when you joined? 

## I don’t have the time to join another social network

- is it free and open
- Why do people keep inviting me to their instances
- Can instances talk to each other
- Does it matter which instance you join

> “While I've been thinking about and working on this problem since the very beginnings of Twitter, I haven't had much success at addressing these problems. Nor has anyone else.
>
> These are *hard problems*. Facile criticism of earnest efforts isn't going to get us anywhere. 
>
> Which isn't to say criticism isn't warranted. There are many legitimate issues. But if the argument defaults to "so we should all just continue to hang out on and moan about Twitter" it seriously undercuts the legitimacy of any criticism.” —[Blaine Cook on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blaine/status/1030586266532933633?s=21).
