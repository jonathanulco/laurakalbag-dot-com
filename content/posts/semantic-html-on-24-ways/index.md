It’s been a few years since I wrote something for [24ways](http://24ways.org), but this year I’m back, [making the case for semantic HTML](https://24ways.org/2017/accessibility-through-semantic-html/).

As I mention in the article, I see a lot of redundant and unsemantic HTML while I’m working on [Better](https://better.fyi). HTML is often seen as easy, and therefore not worth learning in detail. It’s frustrating because HTML is one of the few completely unavoidable technologies of the web. It doesn’t take much to better understand how to use it effectively, and it can make a huge difference to the accessibility of a web page.
