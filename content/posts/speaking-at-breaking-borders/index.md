Next month I’m speaking at [Breaking Borders](http://breakingborde.rs/). Breaking Borders is a brand new, totally free, bi-monthly event in Reading organised by my good friend, [Ben MacGowan](http://www.benmacgowan.co.uk/).

The inaugural Breaking Borders event will have the lovely Steve Workman speaking about *Front-end web architectures that won’t bite you (in the ass)* and me speaking about design systems.

If you’re in the area, I really recommend you join us. If Ben’s events are anything like his front-end development skills, it’s going to be great!
