The first exercise we’ve been given is to capture a splash in a cup…

{{< figured caption="**First splash.** My kitchen is in a basement, so it’s a little bit dark. Even with the ISO jacked all the way up, this was the lightest I could get with the fastest possible shutter speed." >}}

{{< figured caption="**Second splash.** So I went outside! Unfortunately my burst caught the splash a bit late." >}}

{{< figured caption="**Best splash.** Finally got the hang of it. Though I wonder if the plant pot on the left spoils the composition." >}}

{{< figured caption="**Best splash, cropped.** If I crop the pot out, but keep it landscape, I cut too much of the splash out. I’m not sure if square works either." >}}
