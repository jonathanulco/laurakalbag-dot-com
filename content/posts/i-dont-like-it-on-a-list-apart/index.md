Heh. That’s a misleading title! I’ve been on holiday, so I’m late to posting this update. Just over a week ago, [my most recent column, I Don’t Like It](http://alistapart.com/column/i-dont-like-it), was posted on A List Apart. I’d heard some designers discussing their clients in less-than-favourable terms. This kind of behaviour makes me cross. It’s the [Clients From Hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/) attitude that poor communication is a client’s fault, when [it’s more often a designer’s fault](http://alistapart.com/column/good-designers-good-clients "Column on Good Designers, Good Clients"). It might be easier to talk about these situations in the abstract than give solid advice on how to behave better. So I gave it a try, with some example interactions in my column.
