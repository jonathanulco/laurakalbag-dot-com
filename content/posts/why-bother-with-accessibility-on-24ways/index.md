[My article](http://24ways.org/2013/why-bother-with-accessibility/) for this year’s [24ways](http://24ways.org) has been published today. I wrote “Why Bother With Accessibility?” after giving my [Designing For Accessibility talks](https://speakerdeck.com/laurakalbag/designing-for-accessibility-2), and still coming up against the same excuses. I wanted to write something that could be a go-to for people trying to understand why designing for accessibility was worthwhile. Fingers crossed that this helps, because we can’t talk about accessibility enough!
