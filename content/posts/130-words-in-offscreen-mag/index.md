I’m slightly behind on my posts, but I wanted to share my contribution in the latest edition of [Offscreen Magazine](http://www.offscreenmag.com). Offscreen is a beautiful, printed, independent magazine about the “People behind Bits and Pixels.” I contributed 130 words to Issue 10 on getting into a creative mindset.
