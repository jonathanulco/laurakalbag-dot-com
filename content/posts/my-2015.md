I’m not even sure how to write about 2015… 2015 can die in a fire, go away and never come back.

My mother died in August, three months after her mother, my grandmother, died in April. Missing them both has really done me over. Grieving is not what I expected, it just makes everything exhausting. Oddly, knitting helped.

In July, we moved from Brighton to Reigate to stay with my family. We intended to stay a couple of months while we [planned our move abroad to escape the Tories and their Investigatory Powers Bill](https://ar.al/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/). By chance, I got a month at home with my mother before she died.

[At Ind.ie we were struggling for money](https://ind.ie/blog/happy-indie-new-year/), and I wanted to be close to my family, so it made sense to stick around in Surrey. It now just about feels right (and just about affordable) to move away.

Looking back, [my fitness, reading, and writing goals from 2014](/my-2014/) seem trite. Ind.ie is still incredibly important to me, and I’m sure we’ll do more great things in 2016. [Aral’s blog post](https://ind.ie/blog/happy-indie-new-year/) sums up our Ind.ie year well.

## Goals for 2016

1. Be efficient. Busywork isn’t productivity.
2. Make the most of everything.
