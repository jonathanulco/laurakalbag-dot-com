At the beginning of the week, I had fun talking to Victor Johnson on [Episode 9 of the Subjective podcast, ‘Free As In Liberty.’](http://subjective.fm/episodes/9) I ranted **a lot**, and we talked about Ind.ie, diversity, my upbringing, and how I got into design and the web.

[Subjective](http://subjective.fm) is also a great podcast in its infancy, with Victor at the helm, it’s definitely one to watch (or listen!)
