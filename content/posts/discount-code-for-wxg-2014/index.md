You might have seen that I’m speaking at WXG in Guildford in September. If you didn’t already get a ticket, you might want to use my discount code of **kalbagWXG** to get £10 off the (already very affordable £99) ticket price.

There’s some great speakers in the lineup, and it’s sure to be a fun day!
