I’m not committing to any weekly anything! Incidentally, here’s the best bookmarks I saved in Week 9, 2019.<!--more-->

## Silicon Valley

If you used to read my [Ind.ie roundups](https://ind.ie/news) or you follow [@indie@mastodon.ind.ie on Mastodon](https://mastodon.ind.ie/@indie) and [@indie on Twitter](https://twitter.com/indie) (I post lots of links there!), you’ll know I’ve always got something to populate this category. I am not your breathless startup cheerleader. Links this week feature Facebook and Google being XYZ and UK and EU regulators trying (and often failing) to rein the Silicon Valley X in.

### Nest Secure had a secret microphone, can now be a Google Assistant

By on

### The Reply Guy Constitution

By on

> “Section 2 – The Comment. Our replies to all tweets shall fall into one of the following categories: unsolicited advice, explanation, contrarian comment, request for research to be done on Our behalf, improvement upon the joke, and/or sucketh upping. When We cannot think of a proper reply to the tweet in question, a .gif of minimal relevance shall suffice. Above all, no woman shall be excluded from Our familiar and chummy tone.”

### Facebook labelled 'digital gangsters' by report on fake news

By David Pegg on The Guardian

>
> “We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.”

### Why a focus on “fake news” and Facebook misses the internet’s real problems - and solutions

By Jennifer Cobbe on Open Democracy

> “The biggest oversight… is in diagnosing disinformation as essentially a problem with Facebook, rather than a systemic issue emerging in part from the pollution of online spaces by the business model that Facebook shares with others: the surveillance and modification of human behaviour for profit.”
