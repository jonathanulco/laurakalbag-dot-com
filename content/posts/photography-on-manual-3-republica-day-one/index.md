This week, the Ind.ie team are at re:publica in Berlin, so I’m getting lots of opportunities to take photos that aren’t just of the dog!

{{< figured caption="**STG-1 (Stage 1) at re:publica.** A fairly dark location, lit very strongly at one end. I managed to get a blurry walking man against it all." >}}

{{< figured caption="**Close up Aral.** Chopped the top of his head off, and he’s a bit coloured by the red light. I’m pleased I managed to get his face in focus, though it’s stronger around his mouth, whereas I guess the eyes is where we should be aiming for sharpness?" >}}

{{< figured caption="**Between heads.** It’s not the most interesting shot, but I was pleased to get an in-focus photo between the heads in front of me." >}}
