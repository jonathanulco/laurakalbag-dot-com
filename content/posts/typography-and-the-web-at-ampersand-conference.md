Iâ€™ve written [a big old writeup for ubelly](http://www.ubelly.com/2012/06/typography-and-the-web-at-ampersand-conference/) from my notes at [Ampersand conference](http://2012.ampersandconf.com/) earlier in the month.

This was an event I decided not to live-tweet, as the content is usually more involved and in-depth, making for a better big writeup and less tweetable quotes.
