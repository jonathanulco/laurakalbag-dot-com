My site is looking a little different, I’m now using the lovely [Recia](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/recia) for the type. [Fontdeck recently retired](http://blog.fontdeck.com/post/133794978966/why-fontdeck-is-retiring), and while they gave *loads* of notice about the service stopping, I still didn’t update my fonts in time. This left my site looking a little sad and Helvetica-y.

I have a redesign in the works. But I’ve no idea when it’ll be finished. It requires a major reworking in the focus of the site itself. Since I’ve been full time with [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie), the portfolio element of the site is a bit redundant. Although it’s nice to have a history of work, and I’d really like to use it for case studies of the design work for Ind.ie and [Better](https://better.fyi). Most of my writing has also appeared on Ind.ie, or on other sites, but needs to be linked to from here. It’s also time I got my head around all the WordPress theming changes from the last couple of years.

For now, I thought I’d take a step towards the new design with an update in fonts. The typography otherwise remains the same, so apologies for any wonkiness or poor layout!
