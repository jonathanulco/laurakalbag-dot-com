Last week, [my column on The Illusion Of Free](http://alistapart.com/column/the-illusion-of-free) was published on A List Apart. I took a lot of time writing it, as I think it’s an incredibly important issue, and it reflects my thinking around [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie). As ever, a massive thank you to the wonderful editor Rose Weisburd who helped me round things out, made me sound smarter and encouraged me in the first place.
