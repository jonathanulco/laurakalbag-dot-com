Today is the day [my first “thought” of the year is published on The Pastry Box](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/laura-kalbag/2014-january-11). When Alex asked me if I wanted to be a part of The Pastry Box project, I leapt at the chance. There are some fantastic people who have contributed such interesting thoughts and ideas over there in the last couple of years, and looking at [the lineup for this year](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/bakers/year/2014), I’m sure that won’t be changing anytime soon. It’s very exciting to join in, and I really love the [philosophy of consuming content in a way that works for you, and ensures the content’s longevity](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/philosophy).

## Ethics

I had a great conversation about ethics in client work with Andy Clarke on the [Unfinished Business podcast](http://unfinished.bz/50) a few weeks ago. In a world where society is clearly struggling with so many issues (wealth/poverty divide, human rights, privacy, and so on) I wonder how I can make a difference, or prevent myself from being complicit in further problems.

In the run-up to my publishing date on The Pastry Box (it’ll likely be the 11th of each month) I was so worried about what I would write, and trying to come up with something interesting. Then I read [this post by Cory Doctorow](http://mostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com/post/72759474218/we-are-huxleying-ourselves-into-the-full-orwell), and had some worrying conversations about other people’s attitude to privacy with [Aral](http://aralbalkan.com). Suddenly I found myself writing an incoherent stream of anger into my notebook. A long thoughtful walk with the dog later, and I finally had something that might be worth sharing.

Please let me know what you think, this means a lot to me.
