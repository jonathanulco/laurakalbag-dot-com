Last Friday afternoon, I had a lovely chat with Liz Elcoate about ethics, inclusivity and accessibility in design and branding. That chat is now available as Episode 4 of Liz’s podcast, [The Elastic Brand](http://theelasticbrand.com/episode/ep-4-laura-kalbag/).<!--more-->

Too often, designers feel like they’re operating on the whims of their clients or employers, implementing design in a superficial manner, not able to have an impact. We discuss how that doesn’t have to be the case, and how we hope our insecurities are making us better people and designers!
