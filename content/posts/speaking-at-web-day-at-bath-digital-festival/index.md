I’m speaking at [Web Day at Bath Digital Festival](http://2014.bathdigitalfestival.com/event/web-day/) on the 28th of October. Bath is great, I went to university there, and it’s full of lovely people. I’m looking forward to going back and giving a talk about accessibility. [Tickets are a very reasonable £15](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/web-day-tickets-13137878749), and it looks like it’ll be a very interesting day.
