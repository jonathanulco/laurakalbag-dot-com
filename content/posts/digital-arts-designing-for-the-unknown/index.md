Last week, Craig Grannell asked me some questions about designing for the unknown. The result was a really fantastic article called [Designing for the unknown: how to design templates and frameworks](http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/graphic-design/designing-for-unknown-how-design-templates-frameworks/), and has contributions from some really smart people.

The title image is from my writeup of the [Default Perch Theme project](/project/default-perch-theme/ "Default Perch Theme") I did with Perch.
