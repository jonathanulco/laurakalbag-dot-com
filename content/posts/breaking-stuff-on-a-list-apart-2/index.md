Last week [my latest column, Breaking Stuff](http://alistapart.com/column/breaking-stuff), was published on A List Apart. I’m in a strange transitional period, moving from client work to fulltime at [ind.ie](https://ind.ie), so I think I’ll be writing more about situations like these as time goes on.

I’ve also finally updated that terrible avatar to something much better. I look uncharacteristically pale, but at least I’m normal colours! (Unlike the last terrible photo I’d used.)
