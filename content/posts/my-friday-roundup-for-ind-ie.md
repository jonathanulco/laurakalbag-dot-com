Every Friday I write a roundup of great links we at [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie) have seen over the last week. I’m not going to lie, it’s a lot of fun. I finally have an excuse to sit and properly read articles that are related to independence, privacy, human rights, democracy, diversity and more. I feel more well-informed as a result!

The roundups started out as just lists of links, but have now evolved into a little article each week where I collect the best reads together under common themes and occasionally a bit of analysis. [Read today’s Friday Roundup](https://ind.ie/blog/roundup-15-04-04/).
