Yesterday, Heart Internet posted [an interview with me](http://www.heartinternet.co.uk/blog/article/interview-with-web-accessibility-champion-laura-kalbag) on their site. They start off saying some very kind things about me, and then it covers accessibility, design, speaking at conferences and a bit of client work. As a bonus, itâ€™s interspersed with photos of me pulling weird faces at conferences (and being business on the phone!)
