Last October, [Web Standards Sherpa](http://webstandardssherpa.com) published my [mini series on Getting Started With Sass](http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/getting-started-with-sass-part-3/). It was a whole new experience as I’d never written a technical tutorial as in-depth as this, let alone doing so with a proper editor and technical editor. Web Standards Sherpa is like that; all about the quality. So it was sad to hear about Sherpa closing its doors this year. However, in order to keep the site and all its wonderful resources online forever, Web Standards Sherpa is hosting an online conference on the 23rd April, and I’m speaking.

## Sherpa Summit

It’s an online event, so you can attend from wherever you have an internet connection. And if you can’t make the sessions, a ticket will also buy you the videos afterwards. I’m speaking first (lucky for me as I’m not in the same timezone!) and then there’s talks from fantastic speakers covering a wide range of web-related topics. There’s also two roundtable sessions where you can ask questions and interact with the speakers, all from the comfort of your computer.

Individual tickets are just $99, but you can get a whole 20% off if you use the code *LAURA*.
