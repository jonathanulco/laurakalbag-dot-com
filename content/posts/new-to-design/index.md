Following my [learning design post](/learning-design/ "Learning Design"), I’ve started a little project called “new to design.” At the moment it just consists of [a learn-design tag on my Pinboard bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:laurakalbag/t:learn-design/) and a [Twitter account @newtodesign ](http://twitter.com/newtodesign)so that I can share useful design resources (especially for those new to design.)

In the future, I hope it can be useful in other ways. Any suggestions or anything you want to see? [You know how to get in touch…](/contact-me/ "Contact Me")
