On Saturday evening, I had a lovely chat with Jenell Pizarro, Brian Hinton and  Frederick Philip Von Weiss for their Thunder Nerds podcast. You can [watch the video or listen to the audio on the Thunder Nerds site](https://www.thundernerds.io/2018/10/surveillance-capitalism-accessibility-w-laura-kalbag/).<!--more-->

After seeing their [impressive previous guest list](https://www.thundernerds.io), and listening to a couple of their recent shows, I was excited to chat to such friendly and enthusiastic folks. We covered a whole lot of topics, including privacy, business models and accessibility. I always worry that I ramble a bit on podcasts like this, but Jenell, Brian and Frederick were very kind and held a fun discussion.

I’ll definitely be listening to their back catalogue, and keeping an ear out for their new guests in the future.
