A couple of weeks ago I posted [a quick note mentioning I now have my own Mastodon instance](/notes/2018/08/06/16/45/). But first things first: why?

My aim is to use Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter. While Mastodon is not equivalent to Twitter, many of its features are similar. This includes Mastodon’s primary use: publishing text-based posts with a character limit to a publicly-visible feed. And I’m looking for an alternative to Twitter because Twitter is not good for me.<!--more-->

Sometimes I assume me saying “Twitter is not good for me” is self-explanatory, but it’s not a universally-held opinion. It’s worth explaining in a little more detail:

## Surveillance capitalism

In short, what is wrong with Twitter is [surveillance capitalism](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism). If you’re not already familiar with the term, surveillance capitalism is the business model of mainstream technology. The technology tracks us, watching what we do—that’s the surveillance bit. And then uses that information to better sell to us, often through “relevant” advertising—that’s the capitalism bit. For clarity and brevity, [Aral calls it “people farming.”](2018.ar.al/notes/encouraging-individual-sovereignty-and-a-healthy-commons/)

On social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, we are generally aware that the ads we see fund the service that we use. However we are less aware of how algorithms affect which posts we see in our social network feeds, and [what information is used to feed those algorithms](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/algorithms-rate-credit-scores-finances-data). We are also less aware of how those [algorithms, and the interface around it, are designed to manipulate us to interact with the service](https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-exec-you-don-t-realize-it-but-you-are-1821181133). We are even less aware of how [most technology uses tracking, and their own algorithms](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/07/black-mirror-season-4-netflix-metalhead/), to [addict us and manipulate our behaviour in a manner that is financially beneficial to them](http://crackedlabs.org/en/data-against-people). (If this all sounds far-fetched, have a look at my [blog version of my talk on ‘Digital Assistants, Facebook Quizzes, And Fake News! You Won’t Believe What Happens Next’](/you-wont-believe-what-happens-next/).)

## What is wrong with Twitter… specifically?

Twitter’s business model of surveillance capitalism has an impact on every decision that Twitter makes.

### Twitter does not adequately deal with abuse

Moderating abuse is not easy. Deciding on what constitutes abuse, and how to appropriately deal with it, is an issue with every publishing platform. Anti-harassment tools are not enough, However abuse and harassment are . Freedom of speech and censorship.

If Twitter were to stick to a strict abuse and harassment policy, there would be fewer tweets.

If Twitter were to give us adequate tools to moderate our own Twitter feeds, @replies, and messages, it would likely impact what the algorithm chooses to show us.

In short, Twitter does not deal with abuse because surveillance capitalism.

### Twitter actually encourages abuse 

Twitter lets abuse and harassment continue because engagement thrives on 

In short, Twitter encourages abuse because surveillance capitalism.

### Twitter’s algorithm has done away with the chronological timeline 

Much like Facebook before it, Twitter’s decision to use algorithms to dictate what you see in your feed, rather than showing posts in a chronological order, means you can’t rely on the feed to show you 

In short, Twitter no longer has a chronological timeline because surveillance capitalism.
- You do not know if your tweets are being seen, or if you are seeing your friends tweets, because algorithm, because surveillance capitalism

My points above are not particularly nuanced. There are situations and design decisions around the algorithmic timeline and the handling of harassment and abuse that are not primarily to serve surveillance capitalism. But because Twitter’s business model is focused around extracting information from people, these design decisions will always be prioritised.

## But a lot of people are still fine with Twitter

- Some people will say they don’t mind this exchange, but they are either naïve or have an agenda for continuing in this status quo
- Link to my post on the cost of access

> “While I've been thinking about and working on this problem since the very beginnings of Twitter, I haven't had much success at addressing these problems. Nor has anyone else.
>
> These are *hard problems*. Facile criticism of earnest efforts isn't going to get us anywhere. 
>
> Which isn't to say criticism isn't warranted. There are many legitimate issues. But if the argument defaults to "so we should all just continue to hang out on and moan about Twitter" it seriously undercuts the legitimacy of any criticism.” —[Blaine Cook on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blaine/status/1030586266532933633?s=21).

### How do you know if the technology you are using is tracking you?

- you don’t, but also privacy policy
