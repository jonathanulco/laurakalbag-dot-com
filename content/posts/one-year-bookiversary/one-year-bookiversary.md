It’s been one whole year since my book, Accessibility For Everyone, came out in paperback and ebook.<!--more-->

Did you read it? Did it help you make more accessible websites? If you didn’t read it yet (or even want to read it again…!) you can always listen to [the audiobook on Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B07G24HLXS). The whole book takes less than an afternoon…
