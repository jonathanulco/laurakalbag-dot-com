Over the next few days I’m catching up on things I failed to share in recent months. It’s been a very busy few months, but I still like to have a record of what I did and where I’ve been!

In April, I spoke to Neil Bennett about [the future of web design](http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/interactive-design/whats-future-of-web-design/), and the challenges we face. There were some good questions, and it’s interesting to see the answers of difference people from different areas side-by-side.
