I first joined Mastodon (mastodon.social—an important distinction I’ll get to later) [in late 2016](https://mastodon.social/@laurakalbag/54674). While I was fairly active on the [@Better](https://mastodon.social/@better) and [@Indie](https://mastodon.social/@indie) accounts, my own account was very quiet. Mastodon.social was already fairly big, and I wanted to have my own instance, and not invest too much of my time in an account that would eventually cease to exist.

I have my own instance, [mastodon.laurakalbag.com](mastodon.laurakalbag.com) where it’s just me and [Oskar](https://mastodon.laurakalbag.com/@gigapup). This is referred to as an “instance-of-one.”

In an ideal world, you should know your instance admin in person. While we aim 
Like a family or a club

## Why set up an instance-of-one?

- Ownership and control

- DMs are not private
- I can block instances, that’s my own choice

## Why not set up an instance-of-one

In a previous post about levels of decentralisation being [beyond my means](/beyond-my-means), I looked at the privilege that make us able, or unable, to embrace owning and controlling our own content.

### Sometimes we don’t want to, or can’t, moderate our own social network

I am a privileged person because I can deal with the low-level harassment I get. This is not a marker of my mental fortitude, it’s just that the worst I get is creepy dudes coming on to me in my DMs, and some people slagging off our work at [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie) in an non-constructive and/or hurtful manner. It is not endless, it is manageable through conventional blocking and muting tools. (I’m also a fan of the pre-block, but that is a post for another day.) I’ve not (yet?!) been the victim of a pile-on, targeted harassment, or more explicit abuse.

But many folks are the victims of this type of harassment and abuse, and they cannot be expected to maintain their own instances. Because in order to be able to effectively block, mute and moderate bad people and things, you have to see those bad people and things. 

Vulnerable people cannot

Being vulnerable and “can’t be arsed” are not the same things.

## How to set up an instance-of-one?

If, like me, you are not great with sysadmin, or just don’t have the time to maintain your own Mastodon instance, I recommend [Masto.host](https://masto.host). At Masto.host, Hugo Gameiro does the installation and hosting of Mastodon instances for X

## It’s what we’re working towards

A clever person I respect asked me “I’m curious to see how a tech-focused solution might work. (If only because many of these issues feel to me like systemic, structural ones.” My answer to them was this:

So much this. But also that we’re stuck with tech that amplifies systemic issues because we don’t have any alternatives, and that we can’t escape because it’s our new infrastructure. We’ve got to try some stuff to see what sticks!
