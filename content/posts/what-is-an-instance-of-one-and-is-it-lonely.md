## Why set up an instance-of-one?

- Ownership and control

- DMs are not private
- I can block instances, that’s my own choice

## Why not set up an instance-of-one

In a previous post about levels of decentralisation being [beyond my means](/beyond-my-means), I looked at the privilege that make us able, or unable, to embrace owning and controlling our own content.

### Sometimes we don’t want to, or can’t, moderate our own social network

I am a privileged person because I can deal with the low-level harassment I get. This is not a marker of my mental fortitude, it’s just that the worst I get is creepy dudes coming on to me in my DMs, and some people slagging off our work at [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie) in an non-constructive and/or hurtful manner. It is not endless, it is manageable through conventional blocking and muting tools. (I’m also a fan of the pre-block, but that is a post for another day.) I’ve not (yet?!) been the victim of a pile-on, targeted harassment, or more explicit abuse.

But many folks are the victims of this type of harassment and abuse, and they cannot be expected to maintain their own instances. Because in order to be able to effectively block, mute and moderate bad people and things, you have to see those bad people and things. 

Vulnerable people cannot

Being vulnerable and “can’t be arsed” are not the same things.

## How to set up an instance-of-one?

If, like me, you are not great with sysadmin, or just don’t have the time to maintain your own Mastodon instance, I recommend [Masto.host](https://masto.host). At Masto.host, Hugo Gameiro does the installation and hosting of Mastodon instances for X
