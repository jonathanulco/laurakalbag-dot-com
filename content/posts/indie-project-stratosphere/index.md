After a few months of being pretty quiet, and working towards our crowdfunding campaign, we’re finally able to reveal [some big stuff about ind.ie](https://ind.ie/).

We’re not just designing a phone. A crowdfunding campaign for a phone that you’ll get in two years is not a risk worth taking. We need to build a network and ecosystem around that phone. We need a fantastic and mature platform that the phone to give the phone the ultimate experience on its release. So that’s what we’re building. It’s not just a phone. It’s not just hardware, software and cloud services. We’re going post-cloud and creating hardware, software, a peer-to-peer network and all of this will be part of the ind.ie ecosystem.
