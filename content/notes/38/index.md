Nearly a year ago I gave a talk at Webstock, and was really pleased with it. It brings together my work on accessibility/inclusivity and ethics. This week, I finally put the slides online in a lovely readable format. (You can find the video there too.)

(Thanks to [Notist](https://noti.st) for making it really easy to upload slides and convert them into something more accessible.)
