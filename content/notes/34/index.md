(East) Londoners! I’m on a panel about ethics in design on Monday night. Come say hello if you’re going to be there. Tickets are free, but it looks like you’ll want to be there nice and early to get a seat!

[Spotify Design and It’s Nice That team up for event taking a close look at ethics in design](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/spotify-design-designing-for-tomorrow-event-100119)<!--more-->
