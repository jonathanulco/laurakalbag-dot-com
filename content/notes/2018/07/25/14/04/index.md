Angry thoughts while updating the Better Blocker blocklistâ€¦ (I get them every time!)<!--more-->

If you are providing third party services on a domain that is entirely unrelated to your (or any previously acquired) business name, you look veeeery sketchyâ€¦

Iâ€™m looking at you, Adobe. ðŸ‘€

If you do this *and* you hide your domain ownership in whois, you are extra sketchy.

<hr />

Nothing makes me angry quite like researching trackers for Better Blocker.

<hr />

Use [Better Blocker](https://better.fyi)? Thereâ€™s new block rules waiting for you. Open the app to fetch them. A couple of little fixes and a couple of new trackers blocked. Iâ€™ll get more sorted over the next week (these were a little tricksy!)

Now I am having a large G&T.
