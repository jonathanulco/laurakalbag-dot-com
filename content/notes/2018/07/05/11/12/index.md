Given that there’s a couple of women in UK parliament throwing the word “prostitute” around, I found this and it seems to be informative:

[Understanding Sex Work in an Open Society](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-sex-work-open-society)

tldr; sex work and human trafficking are different, lumping everything under “prostitution” is unhelpful/harmful.
