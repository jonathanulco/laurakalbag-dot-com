Too many devs in my mentions complaining they have no say about marketing and business depts adding tracking scripts to sites. 

I hear that it’s hard, but if it is genuinely impossible, why are you working there? You have no agency and you are complicit in unethical technology.

Some people don’t have the privilege to change jobs (mostly folks from marginalised groups)…

But let’s be honest, many of you actually do have that privilege. I’m not here to take your excuses, I don’t have that power. You‘re responsible to society to not build shitty tech.
