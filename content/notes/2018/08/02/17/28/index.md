Today I pushed a fairly big update to my site… I’ve now got a [photos section](/photos), and that section is grouped under the [latest section](/latest) alongside [notes](/notes).<!--more-->

This comes from me wanting to add more types of content. Photos and notes are both informal, with photos being the most informal, and I don’t want them to each be in the navigation. They’re just not that important.

The RSS feed for Photos isn’t quite up and running yet. I need to work out how to make the template produce the images in the right manner. This requires more digging into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

But I have got a fancy grid for the Photos list, and pleased with how that’s working out.
