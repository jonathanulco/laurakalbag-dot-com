Just saw yet another insightful and popular tweet by a woman where the replies are filled with men trying to improve upon what she is saying or make room for themselves.

Stop it. Just stop it. If you agree with a person’s perspective, retweet it! It doesn’t have to be about you.<!--more-->

I’m not saying don’t reply. But don’t bother if:
- you’re just repeating their point back at them
- your reply can be summed up as “yes I think so too” (this sounds as pompous on the internet as it does in person)

I’m so tired of participating in the tech industry being an endurance test in fragile masculinity.
