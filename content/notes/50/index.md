There is nothing less reassuring than the HMRC’s updates on Brexit.

No wait! There is something less reassuring… the HMRC’s [“Prepare your business for the UK leaving the EU” tool](https://www.gov.uk/business-uk-leaving-eu). Where you answer 7 questions and it gives you a long list of vague and unhelpful information.

(Not a fault of the tool so much as it being impossible to provide clear information about an unclear situation.)
