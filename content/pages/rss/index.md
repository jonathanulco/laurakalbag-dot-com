You may not want to get all my junk in your RSS feed reader, so I’ve got a few available:

- [**Blog RSS feed**](/posts/index.xml) containing all my blog posts as found at /posts.
- [**Notes RSS feed**](/notes/index.xml) containing all my little notes as found at /notes.
- [**Photos RSS feed**](/photos/index.xml) containing all my photos as found at /photos.

And if you really want *everything*, you can [get the whole lot in my Whole Site RSS feed](/index.xml).
