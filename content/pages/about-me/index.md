## Basics

I’m Laura Kalbag, a designer and British person, now living in Cork, Ireland. I wrote a book about web accessibility called [Accessibility For Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone). You can [buy it in paperback or ebook from A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone).<!--more-->

{{< selfie >}}

I’m one third of [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie), a tiny two-person-and-one-husky not-for-profit working for social justice in the digital age. At Ind.ie, we work on building a more ethical web, make [a web privacy tool called Better](https://better.fyi), and follow the [Ethical Design Manifesto](https://ind.ie/ethical-design).

### How do I pronounce Kalbag?

My surname is Kalbag. It is pronounced **cal** as in **cal**ories, and **bag** as in… **bag**.

## I am a designer

As part of a tiny team, I do a lot under the title of designer. [Aral](https://ar.al) and I work together on the holistic design of Ind.ie. I work on everything from graphic design to web development while learning how to run a sustainable social enterprise.

My work means I’m always striving to make privacy and broader ethics in technology accessible to a wide audience. You can typically find me making design decisions, writing CSS, nudging icon pixels, or distilling a privacy policy into something humans can understand. Sometimes, I [speak at conferences](../speaking/index.html "Speaking") and [write](../tag/writing/index.html) articles, too.

## Principles

Honest, sustainable, and independent design is important to me. I believe the web should be owned and controlled by the people who use it, and we who create technology should do so ethically and responsibly.

I also speak and write regularly about the importance of [accessibility](../tag/accessibility/index.html) and [diversity](https://ind.ie/summit/videos/laura-kalbag) in the tech and design industries. I first became interested in the web because I loved how it made information and shared experiences available to (almost) everybody. I want to work for a web that is equally accessible to all people. And to do that, our industry must be as diverse as the people who use what we create.
