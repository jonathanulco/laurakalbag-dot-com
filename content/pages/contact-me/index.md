## Just Say Hi

If you just want to say hi, it’s definitely best to [contact me on Mastodon](https://mastodon.laurakalbag.com/@laura) or [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/laurakalbag "Laura Kalbag on Twitter"). I’m not on Twitter so much nowadays. You’ll also find me being chatty on the [Ind.ie forum](https://forum.ind.ie).
